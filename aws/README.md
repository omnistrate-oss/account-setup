# Deprecation Notice

We are removing the capability to on-board Cloud Account with Terraform for AWS, taking Cloud Formation 
as a preferred method for you to onboard new AWS Cloud Accounts on Omnistrate and for your customers to 
onboard new AWS accounts. 

This change is to ensure we enable the best experience during onboarding and updating of IAM policies. 
This will not affect existing onboarded accounts, but the existing Terraform stack will not be updated 
to support new features.
